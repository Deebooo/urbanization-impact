## Usage

The repository includes several scripts tailored for different tasks. Here are some examples:

- **Data Processing:**  
  Run `scripts/data_preprocessing.py` to clean and prepare your dataset.

- **Model Training:**  
  Execute `scripts/train.py` to train models that predict or analyze urbanization impacts.

- **Prediction:**  
  Use `scripts/predict.py` to generate predictions using the trained model.

- **Analysis and Visualization:**  
  Use `scripts/analyze_results.py` to generate reports and visualizations of the analysis.

Each script is commented for clarity. Adjust file paths and parameters as needed for your data and analysis requirements.

## Data
